## Parts
### Part 1: `reverse(string)`
Function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string
which is the reverse of the argument.

### Part 2: `substring(target: str, s: str) -> int`
Function that is similar to Python’s string.find(target) method
that returns the offset from the beginning of  string s where target
occurs in s.  Return -1 if target is not a substring in s.

### Part 3: `find_second(target: str, string: str) -> int`
Function that is similar to Python’s string.find(target) method
that returns the offset from the beginning of  string s where target
occurs in s.  Return -1 if target is not a substring in s.

### Part 4: `get_lines(path: str) -> Iterator[str]`
 Function that is similar to Python’s string.find(target) method
that returns the offset from the beginning of  string s where target
occurs in s.  Return -1 if target is not a substring in s.

### Part 5: Write human readable code
Be sure your code includes docstrings and follows the PEP-8 coding
guidelines, e.g. CamelCase only for class names, appropriate spaces,
etc.

Insure that all of your functions include type hints for parameters
and return types.  Be sure to include type hints for all variables.

Provide adequate unittest test cases to demonstrate that your
functions work properly.

## Conventions
- Max character limit per line 80
- CapWords for class names
- snake_case for variables and functions
- function that start with underscore are private
- `support` directory includes files and directory for testing purposes

## Unit Test
For run the unit test execute the following command
```
python HW05_Test_Jose_Cruz.py
